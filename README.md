# DOCTOR-BOT
THIS CODE IS DONE BY ME AND MY TEAM MEMBERS(CODING NINJAS)

PROBLEM STATEMENT

As we know that overburdening of patients on doctors can be a serious problem, as it can lead to burnout among doctors and can lead to decreased quality of care for patients, as doctors may not have enough time to properly diagnose and treat each patient. Many people visit doctors for relatively common illnesses like cough, cold, back pain etc. Also there are many instances when a doctor is not available due to some unfortunate circumstances. What should a patient do in those circumstances?

SOLUTION 

AI in medical care for innovative and improvised way of medication on web platform.

One innovative and improvised way of using artificial intelligence (AI) for medication on a web platform is to develop a virtual assistant or chat bot that can provide personalized medication recommendations based on a user's medical history and current symptoms. This virtual assistant could be integrated into the platform and accessed through a website or mobile app.


IMPLEMENTATION

Here are some specific steps that could be taken to implement this approach:
1.	Collect and store medical data: First step would be to collect and store relevant medical data for each user, such as their medical history, current medications, and any allergies that they might in past. This data could be collected through user input or by integrating the electronic health records of the user.

2.	Develop a natural language processing (NLP) model: An NLP model could be trained on medical terminology and guidelines to understand user input and provide appropriate recommendations. The model could be trained on a large dataset of medical cases and outcomes to learn how different medications and treatment approaches have worked in the past.

3.	Implement a decision-making algorithm: A decision-making algorithm could be developed to analyse the user's medical data and provide personalized medication recommendations based on their specific needs and circumstances. The algorithm could consider factors such as the user's age, gender, medical history, current symptoms, and any potential reactions with other medications.

4.	Integrating the virtual assistant into the platform: The virtual assistant could be integrated into the platform and made available to users through a website or mobile app. Users could interact with the assistant by typing or speaking their symptoms and questions, and the assistant would provide recommendations and guidance.


FUTURE SCOPE
 
•	We see our project as a business model in which our doctor bot will be advanced enough to make the patient's disease less severe in future. 
•	Our bot will collect past medical reports and daily basis data, using which it will create daily reports for patients. It will also provide prevention as needed and help patients obtain medicine from the nearest shop and show the price of the medications. 
•	We have also thought about making an electronic device which will be connected through your doctor bot and it will sense your whole body every day and help the doctor bot to collect essential body conditions and requirements.
